# 5-Breakfast-Recipes
Step 1 - First download the project folder
Step 2 - Make a new project & upload the downloaded folder

Tha app may show city Guides, as at first I thought of making a app showing guides. But later on I zeroed in this idea so,
I used the same project for this app.

The app is very easy to use

The first screen 
List the 5 Recipes with Images
over image  there is 
1- Name of the Recipe
2- Checkbox shows Add to favorite - Click on which, will add it to My Favourite List
3- Get Recipe Button - Click on which  open up on a new screen & shows the recipe details .

Bottom is the 
My Favorite - Click on which shows the recipe you have checked for Add to Favourite.
